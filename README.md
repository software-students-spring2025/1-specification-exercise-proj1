## Stakeholders

**Katie Carlson:** a busy college student

### Goals/Needs of the App:

- Reminders to drink water (e.g., every two hours during the day)
- Setting a custom hydration goal (e.g., 3 litres)
- Tracking history and progress; seeing how many days she hit her goal or missed it
- Motivational features to encourage staying hydrated

### Problems/Frustrations:

- Forgetting to drink enough water
- Struggling to built a habit of staying hydrated and lacking accountability
- Inability to track progress effectively
- Feeling unmotivated to stay hydrated

## Product Vision Statement

An app that helps people more easily meet their hydration goals and stay motivated by enabling users to set reminders, customize goals, log and track their progress-all while growing a virtual plant!
